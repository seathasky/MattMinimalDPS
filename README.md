# MattMinimalDPS
A minimal skin for Blizzard's Damage Meter. Keep it clean, keep it minimal!

Features: Auto-Reset: Blizzard doesn’t auto-reset, so this does it for you. Choose between Off, Instance Entry, or Mythic+ Start, or do it manually via the "Reset Now" button in settings.

Modern Aesthetic: Swaps out the bulky default DPS meter look for a sleek, borderless look with custom fonts and flat textures.
